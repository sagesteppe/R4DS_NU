Mac, by design, hides a lot of the workings of a computer from a user by default. 

Our operating system info is as follows:
```{r, echo = F, comment = ""}
si <- sessionInfo()
writeLines(si[["R.version"]]$version.string)
writeLines(si[["platform"]])
writeLines(si[["running"]])
rm(si)
```


# 1 Create a dedicated folder for R for Data Science

A) First, please create a new R script in your Rstudio. And then run the following commands: 

```{r, eval = F}
current <- getwd()
print(current)
```

[1] "/Users/yourname"

The output should hopefully look like the above; except 'yourname' should be well... YOUR name. If it is not, for example if it looks like this:

[1] "/Users/yourname/Downloads"

Then please create a variable like this:
```{r}
current <- "/Users/yourname"
```

B) Now please choose a name for the folder you want to keep your course materials in. In this example I use 'R_DataScience'
```{r}
new_folder <- "/R_DataScience"
```

Now we can 'paste' together the variables 'current' and 'new folder' using the command below. This will basically just combine the contents of each variable. 
```{r}
folder_2_create <- paste0(current, new_folder)
```

```{r, comment = ""} 
writeLines(folder_2_create) 
```

C) Now let's create a folder to hold our course materials!!
```{r, eval = F}
make.dir(folder_2_create)
```

You will notice R does not create any output from this command. This is because the output occurred in our computer!

D) We can verify this folder exists via:

```{r, eval = F}
setwd(folder_2_create)
getwd()
```

If the output of getwd() matches your setwd location then you are good! 

E) If you are within the appropriate directory ('R_DataScience'), than Create a 'data' folder to store all of our data for this class
```{r, eval = F}
dir.create('data')
```

F) We can verify that this folder exists via:
```{r, eval = F}
list.dirs()
```

This command should basically put out a file 'data'

G) If we want we can change the working directory to that data folder a few ways...
```{r, warning = F, message = F, eval = F}
setwd('data') # if we are in R_DataScience
# OR
setwd('./data') # if we are in R_Datascience
# OR 
setwd(paste0(new_folder, "/", 'data')) # From this current session, 
# not necessarily in R_DataScience

# OR
setwd("/Users/yourname/R_DataScience") # from ANYWHERE on your computer
# OR if we are in a fresh session...
```

Generally when we save an R script in our 'R_DataScience' folder that will change the directory, but you may need to use that last line of code quite often this quarter!


# 2)  Add a feature to the 'Finder' app now.

A) Add the 'Path' feature to your Finder window. (it may already be there...)
1) please open a 'Finder' window
2) Navigate to the top bar of your computer window and select 'View'
3) in the 'View' drop down navigate to 'Customize Toolbar...'
4) select a feature called 'Path' and drag it onto your finder window.

```{r, out.width = "30%", fig.show='hold', echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/amelialitz/R_DataScience/images/Add_path_to_Finder.png")
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/amelialitz/R_DataScience/images/Navigate_to_Customize_toolbar.png")
knitr::include_graphics("/Users/amelialitz/R_DataScience/images/Navigate_to_Users.png")
```

Now please return to your finder window

B) See how to navigate to the folder.
1) Click on your new 'Path' button
2) From the drop down select something like 'Macintosh HD'
3) Within the Finder window select YOURNAME
4) Now you should be able to scroll down to your new folder!!!
  
After you download course files, please move them here. Please put your data folders into the 'data' folder. 

C) Move a file from your 'Downloads' to your 'Data' folder
1) Open a 'Finder' window, if one is not already open. 
2) Use the bar at the top of your window to navigate to 'File' > 'New Finder Window'
3) You should now have two finder windows, in one navigate to 'Downloads'
4) In the second finder window, also navigate to 'Downloads' 
5) In one finder window, using the path tab now navigate to either the 'YOURNAME' folder, or to the 'User' folder and then the 'YOURNAME' folder
6) in the main body of the Viewer Window you should be able to navigate to the 'R_DataScience' folder, and then the 'data' folder, drag your file over. 

# A few examples of importing data from your computer to your R session.

We will load the readr package. 

```{r Load Libraries, warning= F, message = F}
library(readr)
```

Import local data using the Full path. 

```{r Full Path Import, message=F, eval = F}
mydata <- read_csv("/Users/yourname/R_DataScience/Data/phn_modified.txt", comment = "#")
```

Import data from within a directory

```{r Import from within the Current Working Directory, message = F, eval = F}
setwd("/Users/yourname/R_DataScience")
mydata2 <- read_csv("data/phn_modified.txt", comment = "#")
```

Note that this second method is preferred.
